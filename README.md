# shaws-nightmare
The Shaw's Nightmare source code is released for a non-profit use. You need 
the Shaw's Nightmare data to work with this code. If you don't have it you 
can get it at: shawsnightmare.ucoz.com

The bad news: The source code for the Build engine used for this code has 
been lost, so if you want to use another version of the engine other than 
the one supplied, you will have to make some modifications of your own. See 
ENGINE.MOD for details.

To compile it you need OpenWatcom v1.9 with the DOS target installed. 
It can be obtained at www.openwatcom.org

Make a directory named OBJ then type wmake to compile and it will compile 
the code. You will see some warnings as it compiles but you can safely 
ignore them.

SMIXW130.ZIP and MMD.ZIP contain the data you need for the sound engine.

The LIB files consist of the Build Engine data and sound engine required
for compiling.

I don't have a good guess, but I believe that the code will be useful to
somebody.

Have fun,
Michael Muniko
